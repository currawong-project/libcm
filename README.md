_libcm_ is a C application development framework with an emphasis on audio signal processing.

There's a lot that could be said about this framework.  The first is that it is quite large.
More than 150k lines at last count. The best way to get a sense of what is in it
is to [browse the documentation files here](https://currawongproject.org/static/doc/libcm/libcm.html).
